# Kala IMG Quick Optimizer

This module resaves all the managed images on a site.

When you install ImageMagick or another Image Optimizer, it only optimizes future images that are saved.  This goes back and resaves all the things for you.

Even if you change the configuration of the optimizer you can use this to redo all the images.
